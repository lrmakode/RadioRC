# RadioRC is an Library for Arduino Platform, Interfacing with Radio Remote control.

Currently tested with ArudionUNO and FlySky-i6 Remote control. 

How to Uses:

Connect Roll     Channel to Pin connected to Digital PIN-8  of Arduino
Connect Pitch    Channel to Pin connected to Digital PIN-9  of Arduino
Connect Trottle  Channel to Pin connected to Digital PIN-10 of Arduino
Connect Yaw      Channel to Pin connected to Digital PIN-11 of Arduino

For Powering RC-Reciver 5v Output. and GND Pin can be used.
